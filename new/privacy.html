      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Ooiy (the "App") handles information when distributed through app stores (for example, Google Play). The policy is written for the app version of Ooiy and explains what data the App processes, how it is used, and the choices available to users.</p>

      <h2>Short summary</h2>
      <p>The App performs photo and video editing on the user's device. Media files you open are processed on your device. The App does not transmit your photos or videos to our servers as part of normal editing or export workflows unless you explicitly choose to share or upload them.</p>

      <h2>Data the App may access</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Device media files</strong> — When you choose to open a photo or video, the App reads that file on your device to enable editing and export.</li>
        <li><strong>App storage</strong> — The App may store temporary edits, user settings, and small caches on the device to provide a faster editing experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Permissions</strong> — The App may request permissions required for functionality, such as access to device storage (to open and save files), camera or microphone (only if you use features that require them), and internet/network access (only for optional features such as checking for updates or loading optional libraries). You will be asked to grant these permissions at install time or at first use.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How data is used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide the core editing features: filters, trimming, overlays, and export.</li>
        <li>To remember preferences and recent edits so you can continue work later.</li>
        <li>To optionally perform client-side re-encoding or trimming using bundled media libraries.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third-party components</h2>
      <p>The App may include third-party libraries to support media processing (for example, FFmpeg builds). These libraries are bundled with the App or loaded from trusted sources; when included they run locally on the device. Using third-party libraries does not, by itself, mean your media is uploaded off-device.</p>

      <h2>Network activity</h2>
      <p>Network access (internet) is used only for optional features such as checking for updates, downloading optional components, or contacting support. These operations occur only if you permit them. The App does not automatically upload your media files to our servers.</p>

      <h2>Analytics and crash reporting</h2>
      <p>By default, the App does not collect analytics or usage data. If you enable optional crash reporting or analytics features, this will be disclosed at the time of enabling and will require your consent.</p>

      <h2>Sharing and publishing</h2>
      <p>If you choose to share or publish an exported file (for example, upload to cloud storage or post to social networks), that action is performed by the app or by the target service and is done only with your explicit action. Please review the terms and privacy policy of the destination service before sharing.</p>

      <h2>Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain temporary edits and settings on the device only. You may clear the App storage (via the App settings on your device) to remove saved edits and caches.</p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable measures to protect data stored by the App on the device. Keep your device up-to-date and use device-level security measures (screen lock, encryption) to protect your files.</p>

      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>The App is not targeted at children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information through the App, contact us to request removal.</p>

      <h2>Your choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You control which files you open with the App. Do not open files you do not want processed on your device.</li>
        <li>Disable optional network features in App settings if you do not want the App to download components or check for updates.</li>
        <li>Clear App data from your device settings to remove local caches and saved edits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Permissions required (typical)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage</strong> — To open and save media files.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera / Microphone</strong> — Only if you choose to capture media directly in the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Network</strong> — Optional, only for updates, support, or downloading optional components.</li>
      </ul>
